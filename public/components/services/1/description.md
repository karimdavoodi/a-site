The weekly halaqa complements the essence of daily prayers by fostering a collective spirit of learning, sharing, and fellowship. Rooted in Islamic tradition, the halaqa is a circle of knowledge and wisdom where community members come together under the guidance of a knowledgeable leader or scholar.

Through Al Slaam, the practice of daily prayers and the vibrant gatherings of the weekly halaqa, Muslims enrich their spiritual lives, embody peace, and foster unity in the service of Allah and humanity.
